## ✨ Features
- 🔮 Predicts air quality index (AQI) using machine learning models  
- 📊 Reliable trend estimation from environmental datasets  
- 💡 Preventive recommendations for reducing health risks  
- 🌱 Supports sustainable living and smart city initiatives  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy (data processing)  
- Scikit-learn (ML models)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualization)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📊 Dataset
The project uses publicly available **air quality datasets** (temperature, humidity, pollutants, etc.) to train and test the model. Data is preprocessed for missing values, scaling, and feature engineering.
